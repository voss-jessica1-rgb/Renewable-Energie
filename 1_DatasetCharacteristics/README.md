## Dataset Information

### Dataset Source
- **Dataset Link:** [Provide a direct link to your dataset. If the dataset is private, explain the reason and provide contact information for the dataset owner]
- **Dataset Owner/Contact:** [If applicable, provide contact information for private datasets]

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Number of Observations:** [Total number of samples/records in your dataset. For time series data, also specify the temporal resolution (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.)]
Number of samples: 874
We have daily data from 23.06.2023 to 13.11.2025
- **Number of Features:** 12

### Target Variable/Label
- **Label Name:** Solar Power generation (kWh)
- **Label Type:** Regression
- **Label Description:** 
 Our label is the solar power generation of a solar plant.We want to predict the solar power generation of a privatly owned solar plant, by using a weather forecast
- **Label Values:** [For classification: list of classes and their meanings. For regression: range of values. For other tasks: describe the label structure]
- **Label Distribution:** [Brief description of class balance for classification or value distribution for regression]

### Feature Description
[Provide a brief description of each feature or group of features in your dataset. If you have many features, group them logically and describe each group. Include information about data types, ranges, and what each feature represents.]

**Example format:**
- **Feature 1 (feature_name):** [Description of what this feature represents, data type, and any relevant details]
- **Feature 2 (feature_name):** [Description of what this feature represents, data type, and any relevant details]
- **Feature Group (group_name):** [Description of a group of related features]
