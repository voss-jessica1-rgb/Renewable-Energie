**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Forecasting renewable energy for microgrids using machine learning

  - **https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-025-06895-5**
  - **Objective**: Objective of this paper is use machine learning to improve the accuracy of renewable energy generation forecasting, with a focus on PV energy generation and wind availability forecasting
  - **Methods**: Open datasets with historical data were used, including PV-generation and weather data. The datasets were preprocessed, they were distributed in training, validation and test sets. Three models were used to find the best one: a baseline model, a 1-D-CNN model and LSTM.
  - **Outcomes**: The results show that the 1-D-CNN model performs better than the LSTM model for time series forecasting. Using machine learning techniques, the accuracy of energy prediction was succesfully improved.
  - **Relation to the Project**: The paper is similar to the project we want to do, since it also uses weather data to predict the production of renewable energy.
